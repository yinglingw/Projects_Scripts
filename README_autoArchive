Written in BASH, the purpose of the script is to run clean up and archiving of a Digital Terrain Model 
product after the map has been fully created. The files are moved from a local computer
to a remote server for permanent storage. 

Additionally, there is a second half of the process alluded to within the script but I have not it published here.

The script has been modified from its original form in order to mask some 
of the more sensitive connections the script makes.
